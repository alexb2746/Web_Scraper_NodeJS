# Web_Scraper_NodeJS

This is for the Full-Stack JavaScript Treehouse Techdegree project #6.

This is a nodeJS application that will scrape the shirt URLS from http://www.shirts4mike.com/shirts.php and grab their information like
the Title, ImageURL, Price, URL and a time stamp. It will convert this information into a csv file inside a 'data' folder.

This program will output and error-log.txt file if there are any errors.
